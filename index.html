  <h1>Crop Yield Prediction System using cloud-based Machine Learning models across Telangana state</h1>

  <p></p>
  <p class="para">Agriculture forms the backbone of our civilization, providing sustenance and nourishment to billions of people worldwide. In today's fast-paced world, harnessing technology to enhance agricultural practices is crucial for sustainable food production. Automatic crop yield prediction emerges as a vital tool that empowers farmers and stakeholders with valuable insights for optimizing agricultural operations</p>
  <p class="para">Efficient utilization of resources is paramount for sustainable agriculture. Automatic crop yield prediction assists farmers in optimizing resource allocation, including water, fertilizers, and pesticides. By precisely estimating crop yields, farmers can avoid over- or under-utilization of resources, reducing waste, minimizing environmental impact, and maximizing productivity</p>
  <p class="para">Sustainability is crucial to preserve the environment and ensure agricultural viability for future generations. Automatic crop yield prediction facilitates the implementation of sustainable farming practices</p>
  <p class="para">When it comes to pollution and climate change, the environment and agriculture suffer the quickest and with the most clear consequences.  If effective changes aren’t made, climate change’s impact on agriculture will decimate a country’s economy and eventually wipe out the food supply</p>
  <h2>Importance of Crop Yield Prediction</h2>
  <p class="para">Crop yield prediction is an essential task for the decision-makers at national and regional levels for rapid decision-making. An accurate crop yield prediction model can help farmers to decide on what to grow and when to grow.</p>
  <p class="para">To prepare for the coming disaster, developing nations like India with their exponential population increase should concentrate on cutting-edge agricultural technologies. Early-stage crop yield prediction is one of the most important activities since it is one of the most difficult tasks in precision agriculture because it necessitates a thorough comprehension of the growth pattern with the highly nonlinear characteristics. </p>
  <p class="para">Environmental factors including humidity, temperature, and rainfall, as well as management techniques like irrigation, herbicides, and fertilizers, are quite dynamic and differ from field to field. Data for the proposed work were gathered over a 10 year period from five different fields like Cotton, Maize, Rice, Wheat and Groundnut in 32 districts across Telangana.</p>
  <h2>Data Set Collection Process</h2>
  <p class="para">Crop yield is primarily dependent on attributes like temperature, Rainfall, Irrigation level, soil type and also  on soil nutrients ( M,N,K,Zn,Cu). We predicted yield based on these parameters and data is collected from different sources</p>
